# Previous Review of Trip (complete review, with more details, will be in Final Report)
The main aim of the trip was the RFI analysis using two spectrometers (FPH and FieldFox), and two different types of antennas (omnidirectional and directional), another aim was to try to find positions for Outriggers. Before the visit, we used the anechoic chamber (UFCG), and the surrounds of the LABMET (UFCG), to find the best equipment configuration for the trip measurements (the anechoic chamber measurements are in the folder). We measure six BINGO site points and seven points outside (three with more than 7km distance from the site). In the site point sites, we did measurements with both antennas and at different day times.
