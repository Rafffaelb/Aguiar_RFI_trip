# Previous Review of Trip (complete review, with more details, will be in Final Report, which will be uploaded as a PDF file)
From 11th Feb to 13th Feb the group with: Jordany Vieira, Rafael Batista, and Lucas Santana, traveled to the BINGO site where the main aim of the trip was the RFI analysis using two spectrometers (FPH and FieldFox), and two different types of antennas (omnidirectional and directional), another aim was to try to find positions for Outriggers. 
Before the visit, we used the anechoic chamber (UFCG), and the surrounds of the LABMET (UFCG), to find the best equipment configuration for the trip measurements (the anechoic chamber measurements are in the folder). 
On this trip, we measure six BINGO site points and seven points outside (three with more than 7km distance from the site). In the site point sites, we did measurements with both antennas and at different day times.
